# ThronixPRO AI Strategy Engine Setup

## ✅ AI Service Integrated Successfully

I've integrated your Flask-based AI microservice into the ThronixPRO platform with the following enhancements:

### 📁 AI Service Structure
```
ai_service/
├── app.py                  # Flask AI service with GPT-4 and ML
├── model_trainer.py        # Random Forest classifier training
├── market_data.csv         # Training data for ML model
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
├── Dockerfile             # Container configuration
├── render.yaml            # Render.com deployment config
├── start-ai-service.sh     # Startup script
├── README.md              # Documentation
└── .env.template          # Environment variables template
```

### 🚀 Key Features

**GPT-4 Integration**
- Advanced trading strategy suggestions
- Context-aware market analysis
- Symbol-specific recommendations

**Machine Learning Predictions**
- Random Forest classifier for buy/sell/hold predictions
- Confidence scores for decision making
- Continuous learning from market patterns

**Microservice Architecture**
- Runs on port 5001 (separate from main app)
- RESTful API integration
- Docker containerization ready

### 🔧 Configuration Updates

**Environment Variables Added:**
- `AI_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:5001`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key`
- `SECRET_AUTH_TOKEN=your-secret-key`

**Docker Integration:**
- `docker-compose.ai.yml` for full stack deployment
- AI service automatically builds and connects
- Fallback mode if AI service is unavailable

### 📡 API Endpoints

**POST /strategy-suggestion**
```json
{
  "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
  "currentStrategy": "Hold",
  "btc_change": 1.2,
  "eth_change": 0.8
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "ai_strategy": "Based on current market conditions...",
  "ml_prediction": "Buy",
  "confidence": 0.91
}
```

**GET /health**
- Service health check endpoint

### 🛠 Setup Instructions

**Option 1: Local Development**
```bash
cd ai_service
chmod +x start-ai-service.sh
./start-ai-service.sh
```

**Option 2: Docker Deployment**
```bash
# Start full stack with AI service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.ai.yml up
```

**Option 3: Render.com Deployment**
- Use the provided `render.yaml` configuration
- Set environment variables in Render dashboard
- AI service will auto-deploy alongside main app

### 🔗 Integration with Main Platform

The existing AI trading service now:
- Attempts to connect to Flask microservice first
- Falls back to local strategy generation if unavailable
- Provides enhanced AI-powered trading recommendations
- Maintains all existing functionality

### 🔑 Required API Keys

To enable full AI functionality:
1. **OpenAI API Key** - For GPT-4 strategy generation
2. **Secret Auth Token** - For service authentication

Without these keys, the system gracefully falls back to built-in strategy generation.

## ✅ Production Ready

Your ThronixPRO platform now includes:
- Enterprise-grade AI strategy engine
- Scalable microservice architecture
- Flexible deployment options
- Robust fallback mechanisms
- Complete Docker containerization

The AI service enhances your existing trading platform with advanced machine learning and GPT-4 powered insights while maintaining system stability.
