# GitHub Setup Instructions for ThronixPRO

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and managing the ThronixPRO repository on GitHub.

## Initial Repository Setup

### 1. Repository Creation
```bash
# Create new repository on GitHub
# Repository name: ThronixPROapp
# Description: Professional Cryptocurrency Trading Platform
# Visibility: Private (recommended) or Public
```

### 2. Local Repository Initialization
```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/FLEM1998/ThronixPROapp.git

# Set default branch
git branch -M main

# Initial commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: ThronixPRO trading platform"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Authentication Setup

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token with following permissions:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
   - `write:packages` (Upload packages to GitHub Package Registry)
3. Use token as password when pushing:
```bash
git push https://FLEM1998:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/FLEM1998/ThronixPROapp.git
```

### Option 2: SSH Key Setup
```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"

# Add SSH key to ssh-agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Copy public key to clipboard
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Add to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
```

## Repository Configuration

### Branch Protection Rules
Set up branch protection for `main` branch:
1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Include administrators

### Repository Secrets
Add the following secrets in Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:
```
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_character_encryption_key
RESEND_API_KEY=your_email_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
KUCOIN_API_KEY=your_kucoin_api_key
KUCOIN_SECRET_KEY=your_kucoin_secret_key
KUCOIN_PASSPHRASE=your_kucoin_passphrase
```
